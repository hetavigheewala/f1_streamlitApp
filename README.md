# 🏎️ Formula 1 Data Analysis Project

This **Formula 1 Data Analysis Project** is designed to showcase my skills in data science, programming, and visualization. Through this project, I explore F1 data to analyze driver and team performances, track details, and race statistics. The goal is to create an engaging, informative platform for F1 fans, analysts, and those curious about the sport. 

> **Note**: This project is still in development, so additional features and improvements are planned.

## Project Highlights
- **Driver and Team Profiles**: Detailed data on drivers, teams, and constructors, including performance stats and season achievements.
- **Track Information**: Insights on F1 tracks, including specific details, weather conditions, records, and key events.
- **Race & Season Analysis**: Breakdowns of race-by-race performance, pit stop times, lap times, and points analysis for the 2023 season.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Using a linear regression model, I predict the 2024 driver points standings.
- **Tableau Dashboards**: Two interactive dashboards with visual insights into Constructor and Driver data.

## Skills & Technology Stack
### Programming Skills
- **Python**: Core programming language (version 3.10.2), used for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
- **Tableau**: Interactive dashboards for data visualization and analysis.

### Libraries & Tools
- **Pandas** & **NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib** & **Plotly**: Data visualization and custom chart creation
- **PIL**: Image processing for adding team logos, track visuals, and driver photos

## Features
### Data Exploration
